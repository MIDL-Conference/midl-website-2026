<!-- # Author Instructions

## Presentation Instructions

**Oral Papers**: Each oral presentation is scheduled to last for twelve (12) minutes, and it will be followed by two (2) minutes of Q&A. 

**Poster Papers**: The poster is expected to be printed in portrait orientation with a maximum size of 36 in (width) x 48 in (height). Please plan to hang your poster before the start of the conference day and leave it up for the full day on your assigned poster session day. Each poster session will last for one hour (1h), during which you will have the chance to present your work and discuss it with the rest of the participants. *Note: We ask the authors/presenters to remove their posters at the end of the conference day(before 5:30pm), it would make the life of the organizers easier.*

The detailed program is already available at [Program](https://2025.midl.io/scientific-program).

In case you want to use the MIDL logos on your presentations/Poster, you may find them together with a style guide at: [Logos](https://www.midl.io/logos)

*NOTE: Important: Please contact the local chairs (2025@midl.io) as well as the programme chairs (pc@2025.midl.io) as soon as possible (no later than 7 May 2025!) if none of the authors of your paper will be able to present your paper in person.*

## Submission Instructions

We will be using [openreview.net](https://openreview.net) as a submission and reviewing platform. Please ensure that your paper is registered on the system before the full paper registration deadline. No new submissions will be accepted after this date. However, you may continue to modify your submission—including updating the title, abstract, pdf, and author list—until the full paper submission deadline. After the submission deadline, **changes to authorship will no longer be permitted**, except for reordering existing authors.

<!-- Short papers are **strictly limited to 3 pages (excluding references)** and can, for example, focus on novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept short papers discussing recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from conference attendees. Selection of short papers is based on a light **(single-blind)** review process via OpenReview. All accepted short papers will be presented at the conference. -->

MIDL 2026 offers **two full-paper tracks and one short-paper track**:

Here are the instructions for the two full-paper tracks

- **Main Track – Methodological Development**: New algorithms, architectures, or models for medical imaging; up to **10 pages** (excluding **references**, **acknowledgements**, and **appendices**) at submission; up to **12 pages** after rebuttal for camera-ready version.
- **Special Track – Validation Studies**: A new track dedicated to large-scale or clinically oriented validation of deep learning methods; up to **14 pages** (excluding **references**, **acknowledgements**, and **appendices**) for submission; up **to 16 pages** after rebuttal for camera-ready version.
- There are no page limits for the references and appendices. However, reviewers are not required to read the appendices to evaluate a submission. Full papers will undergo a **single-blind** review process and will be published in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/). Selected papers will be invited for oral presentation. **At least one co-author must present in person**.

All papers must use the official [MIDL LaTeX template](https://github.com/MIDL-Conference/MIDLLatexTemplate) and be submitted via OpenReview. Reviews are **single-blind**, which means reviewers know the authors’ identities, but authors do not know the reviewers’. Papers must be original and not under review elsewhere.

**Please adhere to the official MIDL LaTeX template:** Please note that the all submissions must strictly adhere to the official template. In particular, no alterations may be made to the font size (main text and tables), line spacing, or margins.

To submit a paper, authors need to have an updated [OpenReview account](https://openreview.net/profile).

Inquiries to the program chairs can be addressed directly to [pc@2026.midl.io](mailto:pc@2026.midl.io).

## Rebuttal and Discussion
Authors are expected to submit a comprehensive rebuttal addressing the comments raised by the reviewers during the rebuttal period. In order to fully address the comments of the reviewers, the authors are free to modify or add any additional details, experiments or images that might be required in their paper. After the rebuttal, a discussion period will start on which the authors and reviewers will have the chance to interact. Τhe reviewers will be able to see all answers when submitted and can potentially provide feedback. However, it is expected that during the discussion period, the reviewers will be more committed and responsive to your answers. The discussion is a unique feature of MIDL, and we recommend taking full advantage of it, as it tends to improve paper outcomes.
 
## Short Paper

In addition to original work, authors can choose to submit a shortened version of a recently published, or submitted, journal publication to foster dissemination of high-quality work. Submissions that are substantially similar to versions that have been accepted or submitted in parallel to other conferences with proceedings are not allowed. Please note the short paper track opens after the full paper review cycle is completed - deadlines are listed on [Important dates](https://2026.midl.io/dates).

In both cases, dual submission of your paper to a non-peer reviewed website like arXiv is allowed. Similarly, submissions that have been presented at non-archival workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings or publish only a very short abstract) do not violate the policy.

Short papers are **strictly limited to 3 pages (excluding references)**. You may include appendices, but note that the main manuscript must be self-contained and the reviewers are not obliged to check the appendix.

This policy will be enforced during the whole reviewing process period.
