# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

As a professional scientific society, we are committed to providing an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas. Consistent with this commitment, this Code of Conduct details how MIDL envisions that participants in MIDL activities enjoy a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment free from threatening conduct, harassment, bullying, and intimidation.

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants at MIDL events and any other MIDL-sponsored or MIDL-endorsed events, both during the events and on official communications channels, including social media.

Participants include but are not limited to organizers, volunteers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, vendors, guests, reviewers, and MIDL staff.

Events include but are not limited to conferences, workshops, tutorials, and conference-sponsored social events.

Participants agree to abide by this Code of Conduct as a condition of participating in one of these events. Participants also agree to comply with other MIDL rules and conditions for these events, which are subject to change without notice.

## Expected standards of behavior

All participants in MIDL events must behave responsibly in all interactions with other MIDL participants: formal or informal social activities, at on-site and off-site locations, in related online communities, and on social media. All individuals participating in activities of the MIDL must comply with the following standards of behavior. All participants at MIDL events are expected to:

* Exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of their surroundings and their fellow participants.
* Alert community leaders if they notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable behavior

Behavior that directly or indirectly interferes with the comfort or safety of other participants will not be tolerated.

The list below provides examples of behavior that violates this Code of Conduct. This list is intended to be descriptive but not comprehensive. Behavior that is not listed here and that impacts the comfort or safety of other participants violates the Code of Conduct.

* Verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, ethnicity, national origin, veteran status or other personal characteristics or identity
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing, unauthorized, or inappropriate photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual or other attention
* Real or implied threat of professional or financial harm
* Real or implied threat of physical harm
* Physical assault
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

Participants asked by any community member to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Reporting violations and investigations

Anyone who is a target of or witnesses behavior in violation of this Code of Conduct may report the violation. MIDL will protect reporters' confidentiality to the extent possible and will accept anonymous reports if the reporter does not want to identify themselves.

Alleged violations of this Code of Conduct should be reported promptly to the MIDL safety officers at [ombudsperson@midl.io](mailto:ombudsperson@midl.io). The safety officers will proceed to investigate as appropriate to the circumstances; however, they may refuse to respond to a complaint determined to be frivolous or vexatious. The decision of when to investigate is at the sole discretion of the safety officers.

The safety officers may recommend any such actions that will result in a fair and just conclusion of the situation. The ultimate goal is to ensure that MIDL events provide a welcoming environment free from threatening conduct, harassment, and intimidation.


## Process

Following the safety officers' recommendation, the MIDL Board sub-committee on disciplinary affairs will review all information provided by the safety officers and issue its decision. Unacceptable behavior may cause removal from, or denial of access to, current or future MIDL events; suspension or termination of membership; revocation of any awards or other recognition from MIDL; and other actions without refund of any applicable registration fees or costs. In addition, violations may be reported to the individual's employer.

If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available.


## Contact information for further questions, concerns or complaints
Individuals who have questions, concerns or complaints related to harassment are also encouraged to contact the conference organizers at 2026@midl.io or the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). 

Information on filing a complaint with HHS OCR can be found at https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/filing-a-complaint/index.html. Filing a complaint with the conference organizer is not required before filing a complaint of discrimination with HHS OCR. Furthermore, seeking assistance from the conference organizer in no way prohibits filing complaints with HHS OCR. 

Individuals can notify NIH about concerns of harassment, discrimination, and other forms of inappropriate conduct at NIH-supported conferences at https://public.era.nih.gov/shape/public/index.era
